Garbage card for home assistant

I wanted to share a card I created to display rubbish collection days.

Instructions:
1. create a new card in HA by pasting the contents of the file: garbage_card.txt
2. in the HA file sensor.yaml, insert the contents of garbage_sensor.txt
3. in the www folder, create a folder with the rubbish images inside
4. modify the various entities with your personal ones
